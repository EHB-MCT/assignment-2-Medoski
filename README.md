# About this Project (CineLytics)
CineLytics is a web application where users can create a personal movie library. Users can add movies they want to watch, have watched, or plan to watch, and track their progress. After watching a movie, they can rate it and leave a short review. The platform helps users keep track of their movie journey in a simple and engaging way.

This is a Development 5 project for the bachelorâ€™s degree in Multimedia & Creative Technologies at Erasmushogeschool Brussels. (2024-2025)
